### About
A [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-powered demo [blog](https://githubtraining-cicd-demo.herokuapp.com). 

#### A Note on Tooling
This project uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for automated testing and deploys to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration). We use these tools because they're popular, free, and integrate well with GitHub. Most importantly, they let us demonstrate and practice CI/CD while abstracting away platform-specific issues. 

That said, there are many other great tools out there offering similar features. We recommend you decide for yourself which tools are most appropriate for your own projects.

Here's [an overview of 3rd party tools that integrate with GitHub](https://github.com/integrations).
